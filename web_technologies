        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The current generation of Web applications (Web 2.0) have made them an outright phenomenon in today’s society helping 
            to redefine the way organisations and individuals communicate and collaborate with each other. 
            The purpose of this paper is to conceptualise the evolution of Web technologies from a user perspective.
            Based on inference from existing studies, this paper attempts to identify the architectural direction that the next generation (Web 3.0)
            of Web applications would meld itself into. The paper emphasizes limitations of current Web technologies and how future trends may address
            these limitations by focusing on migration that has been witnessed in the scope of the applications presented and features delivered 
            on the Web from a users’ perspective.</p>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>From being deployed as a mere group work tool to assist scientists at CERN,
            to being a global information space with more than a billion users, the World Wide Web has exponentially grown in the past 15 years (Anderson, 2007). 
            Through its life cycle, the World Wide Web has been through various phases of development. On the back of widespread acceptance and elevated 
            growth seen by Web 1.0, Web 2.0 emerged to incorporate new online activities, many of which could not have been previously achieved (Boulos & Wheeler, 2007).
            Going by the trend of constant evolution, the Web is now slowly but surely transiting to more data centric phase in the 
            context of Web version 3.0 (Motta & Sabou, 2006).</p>
        <p>Due to its evolutionary nature Web technology has seen a large explosion of new ideas, applications and start-up companies working towards 
            extending and generating new services to add leverage to existing services (Anderson, 2007). In the evolution of the World Wide Web, 
            Web 3.0 is considered to be the next frontier in Web technology which beholds the potential of intelligent information and semantic web. 
            A steady migration towards this new version of the Web could be noticed with instances like coding geocodes on pictures and ability to keep 
            information on an annotation platform with photos in Flickr. Such developments would enable other viewers to see photos from a geographical context, 
            say for instance in a map. One could just click on Fisher-man‟s Wharf in Google Maps and obtain pictures that others have downloaded in Flickr
            (Sankar & Bouchard, 2009). Web searches are another example to elaborate implications of advantage of the Semantic web. This is where Web 3.0 
            artefacts such as the semantic search and its different methods of navigation through the massive data present on the internet would come under 
            focus. On the whole, Web 3.0 promises to enhance data mining with improved search capability, bigger distributed database, intelligent and 
            smart search options across multimedia, improved connectivity between applications and more mobility capabilities (Sankar & Bouchard, 2009).</p>
        <p>This paper therefore would attempt to first delineate Web 2.0 from any arbitrary technologies by identifying evolutionary features and applications 
            that make up Web 2.0 as how we see it today. Second after developing a broader appreciation of the composition of Web 2.0 from a users‟ perspective, 
            the paper would attempt to build a user centric view of the composition of features that would be expected to be incorporated in future generations of
            Web technology. In sum, the paper presents a holistic view of the World Wide Web.</p>
        <h2>2. Understanding Web 2.0</h2>
        <p>Over the recent past, the Web has been transformed from being a medium in which information is transmitted and consumed, to a platform where content
            is created, shared, altered and reproduced (Downes, 2005 cited in Chatti et al., 2008). At the same time differentiation between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 
            is not clearly defined. Indeed Sir Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, has suggested that there is no real difference between the two, 
            as some of the elements of Web 2.0 were fundamental parts of Web 1.0 (Myhill et al., 2009).</p>
        <p>The term „Web 2.0‟ peaked in popularity during the early part of 2007 and was believed to have enormous potential in its features. 
            The concept of „the social web‟ proposed initially by O‟Reilly (2005) has had controversial definitions which were woolly and its validity 
            as a discrete development in the realm of information management has also been questioned. However murky the definition of Web 2.0 may be, 
            its underlying features emphasize flexibility of access, interaction, mobility, multimedia capability, participation, informality and feedback 
            (Abbott, 2010). Though frequently these terms are associated with Web 2.0, the technical developments are not its essence 
            (O‟Reilly, 2006 cited in Harrison & Barthel, 2009). Web 2.0 is instead a label coined by Tim O‟Reilly (2005) and associates to reference 
            the transition of the World Wide Web to a new phase of use and service development (Harrison & Barthel, 2009). Table 1 is used to elaborate on 
            the understanding of Web 2.0 achieved through varied definitions prompted by different authors.</p>
        <h2>2.1 Framework of Web 2.0</h2>
        <p>Sharing tacit knowledge is a major challenge facing knowledge economies of today‟s era (Richards,
            2009). Some part of what we “know” could be expressed, documented, structured and stored in
            repositories such as books, database and knowledge base. In the past, the focus of computer systems
            was on managing data, information and explicit type knowledge was found in expert systems. Of late,
            techniques have emerged for acquiring more implicit knowledge using social software such as Wikis,
            online Communities of Practice (CoP), Weblogs and many others which „helps to realize the original
            vision of the Web as a space where anyone can participate‟ (Schaffert et al., 2005 quoted in Richards,
            2009). The emergence of these behaviours indicates a trend towards which the World Wide Web is
            constellating in, broadly known as Web 2.0. This generation of the Web indulges in a creative use by
            individuals of the existing internet based technologies embedded with information sharing and
            collaboration (Richards, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>Like many important concepts, Web 2.0 does not have a definite boundary that distinguishes it from
            other technologies, but rather is bound by a gravitational core. It could be considered that Web 2.0 as a
            set of principles and practices that branch together a veritable solar system of sites that incorporate and
            demonstrate some or all those features, at varying level from the core (O'Reilly, 2005). The basic
            ethos of Web 2.0 encourages individuals‟ freedom to create, annotate, and comment upon, index or
            share web content- trends which contradict or bypass traditional models of editorial control,
            centralized publishing and professional indexing (Abbott, 2010). Table 2 illustrates the architectural
            framework of Web 2.0. This would help create an in-depth understanding on the - versatility that the
            Web 2.0 carries in its applications.
        </p>
        <h2>2.2 Adoption of Web 2.0 Applications</h2>
        <p>Even though most of the early studies and discussions were directed around the meaning of Web 2.0
            and its applications, on a wider spectrum, Web 2.0 may be defined using features that it incorporates.
            These features that it is integrated with, could be looked at from a technology point of view or based
            on the social impact it creates (Linh, 2008). When Web users need to choose an application, there are
            several factors that a Web user usually keeps in mind, some of those would be: simplicity of
            navigation, financial cost, existence of real social network and their interaction with the site,
            compatibility with people who are also actively engaged in participating in the site, the site‟s visual
            appearance, the amount of user options and privacy protection features. Also it becomes vitally
            important to assess the site‟s offerings with regard to quality and quantity of available applications.
            These include privacy settings, the possibility to generate and manage content and the degree of
            aptitude of the programmers (Isaías et al., 2009). There are a number of Web services or applications
            (for example, User reviews/Evaluation, Wiki, Blog, Content Sharing, Open source software adage,
            P2P/free download, RSS, Mashups, Podcast, Tag Clouds, Social bookmarking, Wikinomics) that are
            considered to be key concepts in Web 2.0 that represent the core fundamental blueprint of Web 2.0
            applications and how it functions.</p>
        <h2>2.4 Shortfalls and Barriers of Web 2.0 Technology</h2>
        <h3>2.4.1 Shortcoming of Web 2.0 Technologies </h3>
        <p>With the emergence of any new technology comes the transition from research work to actual practical
            use and from standards to deployment, all of which impose a time delay. This migration period can
            sometimes be quite long, as shortfalls in technology creep in which are further compounded by
            changing expectations of people. Application developers and manufacturers are reluctant to implement
            products until they see a market forming, but the market does not form by itself until there are enough
            applications at its disposal. The lag therefore typically depends on how soon vendors hear the demand
            from users and can get the prototype applications across to them (Hendler, 2008) and may result in the
            shortcoming of the technology itself. The major drawbacks that Web 2.0 has seen over the course of
            time are: Applications developed focusing human comfort making data confusing (Isaías et al., 2009;
            Morato et al., 2008); lack of intelligent Web servers to avoid bottle necks (Blum et al., 2008; Bojars et
            al., 2008); no appropriate support for RIA UI design (Preciado, 2005 cited in Preciado et al., 2008),
            lack of central authority (Morato et al., 2008; Hsieh et al., 2008); security and privacy challenges
            (Tahamtan et al., 2010), offer Poor query possibilities - lack of generic data representation (Bojars et
            al., 2008), and overload of scattered information with uncertain quality has long been perceived as
            major problem (Abbott, 2010)</p>
        <h3>2.5.2 Barriers to the Current Web 2.0 Technologies        </h3>
        <p>Sometimes even if the new technology meets expectations of the population at large, there are
            probabilities that these technologies may face hurdles from external environment which may limit the
            technology in presenting results which might not be at its optimum and hinder performance of the
            technology as a whole. It is these scenarios which often become a barrier for the technology requiring
            constant research and development effort to overcome them. The prominent barriers that Web 2.0 has
            been faced with currently are (1) Constant iteration cycle of Change and Updates to services
            (Anderson, 2007); (2) Ethical issues concerning build and usage of Web 2.0 (Anderson, 2007); (3)
            Most Web 2.0 services established in the precepts of "free economy" and free community (Isaías et al.,
            2009); (4) Transient technological or social fashions (Abbott, 2010); (5) Interconnectivity and
            knowledge sharing between platforms across community boundaries are still limited (Abel et al., 2007;
            Chan et al., 2009); (6) Since Web is an open medium, there has long been a question over the
            credibility of the websites and the information it holds (Adams, 2010); and (7) The challenge facing
            the web is to make sure that all web developers and web designers follow accessibility guidelines in
            providing descriptions that optimize access to all web users especially the one with disabilities
            (Remenyi , 2008).</p>
